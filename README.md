Synopsis
This project aims to narrow down Twitter searches to a specific profile / feed with recommended keywords that will assist employers.
This is done by searching user timelines, rather than using Twitter's built-in search feature. 
Regular Expressions is used to search for specified keywords once the user timeline is pulled into a .txt file.
